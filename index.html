                <li><b>CSS</b> stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b></li>
                <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
                <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>

            <article>
              <ul>
                <li>Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development</li>
                <li>Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins</li>
                <li>Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Bootstrap 3 vs. Bootstrap 4</h3>
                <p>Bootstrap 4 is the newest version of Bootstrap; with new components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness. <br><br>
                Bootstrap 4 supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 9 and down is not supported.</p>

              <h3>Why Use Bootstrap?</h3>
                <p>Advantages of Bootstrap:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap</li>
                    <li><b>Responsive features:</b>b Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile-first approach:</b> In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework</li>

            <article>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Sass</b> stands for <b>Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet</b></li>
                <li>Sass is an extension to CSS</li>
                <li>Sass is a CSS pre-processor</li>
                <li>Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS</li>
                <li>Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time</li>
                <li>Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006</li>
                <li>Sass is free to download and use</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Why Use Sass?</h3>
                <p>Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain.This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.<br><br>
                Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.</p>

              <h3>How Does Sass Work?</h3>
                <p>A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS. This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.</p>

              <h3>Sass File Type</h3>
                <p>Sass files has ".scss" file extension.</p>

              <h3>Sass Comments</h3>
                <p>Sass supports standard CSS comments <code>/* comment */</code>, and in addition it supports inline comments <code>// comment</code>.</p>

            <p>One of the many JavaScript HTML methods is <code>getElementById()</code>.<br><br></p>

            <h3>JavaScript Functions and Events</h3>
              <p>A JavaScript <code>function</code> is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for. <br>For example, a function can be called when an <b>event</b> occurs, like when the user clicks a button.<br><br> You will learn much moare about functions and events in later chapters.</p>
            
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
              <p>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept   and design.<br><br>
              JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.<br><br>                
              ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="jQuery">
          <header>jQuery</header>
            <article>
              <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of the jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.<br>
                jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.<br>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.<br><br></p>
                
                <p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
                    <li>CSS manipulation</li>
                    <li>HTML event methods</li>
                    <li>Effects and animations</li>
                    <li>AJAX</li>
                    <li>Utilities</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><b>Tip:</b>In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</p>

                  <h3>Why jQuery?</h3>
                    <p>There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable. Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Google</li>
                        <li>Microsoft</li>
                        <li>IBM</li>
                        <li>Netflix</li>

                <li>React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.</li>
                <li>React is a tool for building UI components.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>How does React Work?</h3>
                <p>React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.<br>

                  Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.<br>
                  
                  React only changes what needs to be changed!<br>
                  
                  React finds out what changes have been made, and changes <b>only</b> what needs to be changed.<br>
                  
                  You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutoria</p>

                <li>AngularJS extends HTML with<b>ng-directives</b>.</li>
                <li>The <b>ng-app</b> directive defines an AngularJS application.</li>
                <li>The <b>mg-model</b> directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.</li>
                <li>The <b>ng-bind</b> directive binds application data to the HTML view.</li>

              <li>JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand</li>
              <li>JSON is languague independant</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exchanging Data</h3>
              <p>When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.<br><br>JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.<br><br> We can also convert JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.<br><br> This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.</p>

            <h3>Why use JSON?</h3>
              <p>Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.<br><br> JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format, into native JavaScript objects: <br><br>JSON.parse()<br><br> So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other JavaScript object.

              <li>AJAX is not a programming language.</li>
              <li>AJAX just uses a combination of:</li>

                  <li>A browser built-in <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object (to request data from a web server)</li>

                </ul>
            </ul>

          <p>AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenese. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.</p>
